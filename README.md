# Virtual-drawing-openCV

ðŸŽ¨ Live Webcam Drawing. 

A real-time drawing application built with Python, OpenCV, and NumPy that lets users draw on the screen using a colored object detected by their webcam.
This project allows users to create digital drawings in real-time by simply moving a colored object (like a blue marker or cap) in front of their webcam. The system tracks the object based on its color using OpenCVâ€™s HSV color detection and draws on a virtual canvas using NumPy.

It mimics the experience of painting in the air, making it a fun and interactive way to explore computer vision, object tracking, and creative AI applications.
